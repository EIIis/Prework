CodePath Tip Prework is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Ellis Alcantara Martinez

Time spent: 1 hour and 30 minutes

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features should be implemented:

- [ ] Adressing UI concerns, mainly accessbility for certain users

## Notes

While building my app, since Xcode was a new enviorment, I had trouble setting up the entire workspace. Coming from a VSCode IDE background, I've never been a big fan of heavy IDE's like Xcode, but with help from the tutorial I managed to complete it.
